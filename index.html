                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia with a strong technical skill set including Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS and JavaScript, among many others. I have experience in web development, creating responsive designs and reusable components. I also worked as an Independent Systems Developer, where I built a security-focused equipment tracking system and improved reporting efficiency. My projects include developing a Python game, analyzing seismicity data, and building a hydration tracker app. Outside of my technical work, I have built extensive communication and team building skills with people of all ages from my experience working in retail, children's ministry, and leading youth and camp activities. I'm interested in health and fitness, backpacking, FPV drones, playing guitar and all literally all things tech. I just wish I had more time on this earth to do it all.</p>
